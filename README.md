1. SumElementsOfArray
   
    Given an array T of n positive integers and a positive integer value k, sum and copy the values of T into a new array R such that the sums of consecutive entries in T are less than or equal to the value of k. If an entry of T by itself is greater than or equal to k, it is simply copy into R.
    
    For example:
    
    T = [3, 2, 7, 4, 5, 2, 8, 1, 3, 2, 6] and k = 7
    
    The result should be R = [3+2, 7, 4, 5+2, 8, 1+3+2, 6] = [5, 7, 4, 7, 8, 6, 6].
